## Site Info

This website has as a main theme the **smiling depression**, a functioning depression condition that is quite spread and many times unobserved. Here the developer wanted to give a first information about this condition and raise awareness about it. The general info is then linked to the fictious Institute of Wellbeing in Rome from which a person can require help or more info.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.
