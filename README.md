## Site Info

This website has as a main theme the **smiling depression**, a functioning depression condition that is quite spread and many times unobserved. Here the developer wanted to give a first information about this condition and raise awareness about it. The general info is then linked to the fictious Institute of Wellbeing in Rome from which a person can require help or more info.

The targeted users would be:
  - someone who suffers from smiling depression
  - an introvert working in people-centric spaces and environments
  - someone who is close to a person who suffers from smiling depression
  - someone who is responsible for a wellbeing of the persons in a people-centric envrionment

User should be able to:
  - easily retrieve the general info about smiling depression
  - easily retrieve the info about symptoms of smiling depression
  - retrieve info from the video testimonials and depiction of this condition
  - easily contact the Institute for Wellbeing in Rome 

In order to provide a website that responds to the above mentioned user stories with the corresponding functionalities, the developer must present the smiling depression as a serious condition, the symptoms, the testimonials of this condition and give the opportunity for the user to require more info or help in that regard.
