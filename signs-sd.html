                <p>Very often, people with smiling depression are perfectionists, who take on heavy responsibilities, and
                    are held to high standards, by themselves or by someone else. They fear disappointing others, being seen
                    as weak, disappointing, or unreliable. However, they still experience anxiety, loss of appetite,
                    sadness, fatigue, fear, insomnia, or intrusive thoughts. They just don’t show or talk about them.</p>

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>Smiling depression could be an attempt at a “fake it till you make it” approach to depression. That is,
                    the person may believe that by smiling, laughing, and going about their day-to-day life as if everything
                    were OK, they can eventually force themselves to feel OK. Acting happy just to please the people around
                    you or make them more comfortable can actually be quite isolating, and that feeling of isolation may
                    make depression worse, not better.</p>

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>Smiling depression could be a deliberate attempt by the depressed person to hide their true feelings, but
                    it can also be unintentional. Because someone with smiling depression often seems well-adjusted, happy,
                    and content, they also often receive complimentary feedback on these characteristics. Being told that
                    they’re “so cheery!” or “so successful!” or “so motivated!” when they don’t feel cheerful, successful,
                    or motivated can be confusing. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="article-text">
                <p>Hiding or masking a serious problem like depression is like building an invisible wall between the
                    depressed person and the people around them. If a person with smiling depression does attempt to speak
                    out about it and is met with skepticism and unhelpful comments like, “you don’t seem depressed,” they
                    may withdraw even further, feeling that they won’t be believed or understood. They might doubt their own
                    feelings. They may feel unable to press the issue further or seek out someone else to talk to.</p>
